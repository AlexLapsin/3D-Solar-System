## Fully animated 3D-Solar-System
The project is created using mainly [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) - a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. The project covers some of the main aspects in computer graphics; hence: animation, camera, modeling, rendering, material, texture mapping, lighting and shading.
