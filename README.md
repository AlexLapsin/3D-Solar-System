This project is a 3D solar system visualization built using Three.js and WebGL. It includes animation, rendering, texture mapping, lighting, and shading features to provide an immersive and interactive experience.

The visualization allows users to explore the solar system in 3D, with each planet accurately represented in terms of its size, position, and distance from the sun. The planets and their moons are rendered with high-quality textures and materials, and the lighting and shading effects create a realistic and stunning visual effect.

The application is built using modern API design principles and leverages the power of Three.js and WebGL to provide a smooth and responsive user experience. Users can zoom in and out, rotate the camera, and explore the solar system from any angle, with smooth and fluid animations that respond in real-time.

Overall, this project is an excellent example of how modern web technologies can be used to create immersive and engaging 3D visualizations. Its use of Three.js and WebGL make it a scalable and flexible solution for businesses, educators, or anyone who wants to explore the wonders of the solar system in 3D.
